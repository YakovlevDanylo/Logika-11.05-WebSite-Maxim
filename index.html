			<h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 description</h1>
			<div class="game-info">
				<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 (stylized as Red Dead Redemption II) is a western-themed action-adventure video game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption[4] and was released on October 26th, 2018[5] on PlayStation 4, Xbox One[6] and on November 5th, 2019 for PC.

				Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on the life of Arthur Morgan and his position in the notorious Van der Linde gang. The game follows the gang's decline as they are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton agents. The narrative revolves around the characters of Dutch van der Linde, John Marston (both of whom appeared in Red Dead Redemption) and Micah Bell in addition to Morgan.

					<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in an open world consisting of five American regions, which the player can explore as they proceed with the story, and can be played through both third-person and first-person view. As Arthur Morgan, players can interact with the game world in several ways, including story missions, side quests, challenges, randomized events, and hunting. An Honor system, returning from the previous game, changes accordingly to the player's actions towards non-player characters.

					Upon release, Red Dead Redemption 2 received widespread universal acclaim; it was praised for its writing, themes, characterization, open-world design, visuals, realistic elements and attention to detail, though it also received criticism for its control scheme and the effect of realism on the gameplay. A commercial success, Red Dead Redemption 2 had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment (behind fellow Rockstar Games title Grand Theft Auto V), generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and shipping over 23 million copies in retail.</p>
